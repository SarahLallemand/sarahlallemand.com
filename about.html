            Originally from Montreal, Canada, I moved to London in September to study UX Design at General Assembly. Having recently completed the 10-week immersive, I am looking to work with a team that challenges me to continue to learn. I am excited to take my knowledge and interest to help make clever digital products and seamless experiences.

          <h2 class="about-skills">My Path to UX</h2>
          <p>After a few years not feeling entirely fulfilled with the direction of my career, I discovered User Experience Design while working at a software company in Montreal. Incredibly interested, I was able to work as a part time intern, learning more about field and developing my skills. Wanting to learn more and hone my skills, I moved to London to attend General Assembly's UX Design Immersive, which has been an invaluable experience. </p>
