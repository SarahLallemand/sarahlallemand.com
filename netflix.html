            <h1>Netflix Originals</h1>
            <p>This concept project explores how Netflix Originals series and films can offer more to its followers. It proposes the creation of a micro site which showcases articles and video content related to the series and films. 
              </p> 
             <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Project Brief</h3>
                    <p>For our third General Assembly project we were asked to create a microsite or app to increase social engagement with Netflix Original UK's content.  I worked with three other UX Design students: Ibby Dalrymple, Ece Ozcan and Keith Symonds.</p>

                        <h3>Design Process</h3>
                        <p>Online Research</p>

                        <h3>Scope</h3> 
                        <p>This was a 2 week project and therefore we focused on MVP.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>My Role </h3> 
                        <p>Although most of the tasks were shared, some of the things I contributed to the project were: user interviews, affinity mapping, development of our persona, competitive analysis, user testing and design of the hi-fi prototype.  </p>
                    </div>
            </div>

         </div>
        <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>During the outreach for this project, we quickly learned that the scope was very large, as everyone we contacted either had a Netflix account or knew the login details to a friend or family member’s account.</p>
            
            <div class="project-image">
                    <img src="./assets/netflix-research-discussion.jpg" alt="Netlix Research" />
            </div>

        <h3>Interviews</h3> 
        <p>During our interviews, people had a lot to say about Netflix and amount of content to browse, their recommendations algorithm and the Netflix Originals content. </p>
 
        <div class="project-quotes">
            <p>"There are so many options on Netflix and I get so overwhelmed."</p>

            <p>"The 98% match means nothing to me. I don’t get their algorithm. The numbers always seem high."</p>
            
            <p>"Netflix, HBO and Amazon Prime have elevated the quality of TV shows."</p> 
        </div>

        <p>In total, we interviewed 15 people and were able to collate our findings and come up with some key findings.</p>

        <h3>1 — Time</h3>

        <p>Some Netflix users really enjoy the entire process and invest time in finding a new series or film to watch, watching it and also looking up content related to the Netflix Original once it’s done. Others don’t, and would prefer to spend their time doing something they consider to be more productive. </p>
        
        <div class="project-quotes">
                <p>“I follow the HBO series Silicon Valley on Twitter because I want to be keep up to date.”</p>
    
                <p>“I like to go onto IMDB or Youtube after finishing a show or movie to learn more about it.”</p>
                
                <p>“Its quite a commitment to find a new series to watch.”</p> 
        </div>  
        
        <h3>2 — Motivation</h3>
        <p>Some watch out of boredom, whereas others seek out new films and series, enjoying being immersed into a new world and perspective. </p>
        <div class="project-quotes">
                <p>“The is no better platform than a film to shed light on an issue.”</p>

        </div>  
        <!-- <div class="project-image">
                <img src="./assets/netflix-keyfindings.jpg" alt="Netlix Research" />
        </div> -->
        <h3>3 — Privacy</h3>
        <p>Netflix users like that they have profiles and that their watching habits are not shared or public. They want privacy and like that they get to chose who to share what they watch with. </p>
   
        <div class="project-quotes">
                <p>“I don’t want any more social media and networking apps.”</p>
                <p>“I don’t want others to know what I am watching all the time [for fear of judgement].”</p>
        </div> 
        
        <div class="project-image">
                <img src="./assets/Netflix-affinitymapping-1.png" alt="Netlix Research" />
        </div>

        <h3>Persona</h3>
        <p>We noticed some patterns emerging, and began seeing two types of Netflix watchers, those who enjoyed finding and watching content, and those who watch out of boredom. We decided to focus on the former and created a persona to embody the characteristics from our research. 
            </p>

            <div class="project-image">
                    <img src="./assets/Netflix-Persona.png" alt="Netlix Research" />
            </div>
          
   

        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>We looked at some of the main competitors of Netflix: HBO, ITV, BBC and AMC, and all had microsite that focused on each one of their original series and films. They would provide updates on the series, release dates, as well as video content with interviews, and director’s commentary. Some included articles and reviews related to their originals, and we felt this was an opportunity as <b> Netflix doesn’t offer more than a short description about an episode or film.</b>
          </p>

          <div class="project-image">
              <img src="./assets/Netflix-competitors.png" alt="Netflix Originals Website">
          </div>

          <h3>Problem statement</h3>

          <div class="headline">
          <p>The Connoisseur needs a way to discover content related to their favourite series and films because it adds value to the experience.  </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Scenario</h3>

          <div class="project-image">
            <img src="./assets/Netflix-scenario.png" alt="Netflix Originals Website">
        </div>

            
            <h2>Prototype Development — Designing for mobile</h2>

            <p>Since our user is very likely to go on this website using their phone, we wanted to design for mobile experience first. We decided on a microsite rather than an app because users would want to access the content on all devices and this would allow the website to reach a larger audience. 
              </p>

            <p>
              Once a user lands on the Netflix Originals website, they are presented with a feed of trailers, articles, videos and more. From there, they are able to go onto a film or series page, and have more related content to read, watch and listen to. 
            </p>
            <div class="project-image">
                <img src="./assets/Netflix-prototype-sketches.png" alt="Netlix Research" />
            </div>

            <p>We tested this and moved over to Sketch, and continued to iterate.   </p>
            <div class="project-image">

              <img src="./assets/Netflix-Iterations-mid-fi.png" alt="Netflix Originals Website">
            </div>
            
            <P>The site navigation was what we had iterated on the most throughout the project, and we considered a few ways for users to locate things. Bellow are my notes for the user flow and various site navigations.  </P>
            <div class="project-image">
              <img src="./assets/Netflix-Iterations-navitation.png" alt="Netflix Originals Website">
            </div>

            <p>After developing and testing many mid-fi prototypes, we settled on the primary and secondary navigations. We decided to include search as one of the main menu items, since most users entering the website would know which series or film they wanted to explore more content on. If a user does not use the search then they can click on the series or film sections and locate it by alphabetical order or Genre. </p>
            
            <div class="project-image">
              <img src="./assets/Netflix-site-nav.png" alt="Netflix Originals Website">
            </div>

            <h2>Solution</h2>

            <p>Netflixoriginals.com is a content aggregator with videos, articles and podcasts related to Netflix Originals series and films. It creates an online and offline community of Netflix watchers by introducing events and screenings which takes users out of their living rooms. All of the content on the website it easy to share with friends and family. 
              </p>

            <div class="project-image">
            <img src="./assets/Netflix-Originals-solution.png" alt="Netflix Originals Website">
          </div>

          <p>Using Netflix’s preexisting brand guidelines, we created a style guide and to design the microsite. Bellow is an example of our persona, the Connoisseur, searching for a series, browsing and refining content and looking at the upcoming events in their city. 
            </p>

            <div class="project-video">
                <video width="300" autoplay loop muted controls>
                    <source src="./assets/netflix-hifi-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                      <p class="warning">Your browser does not support HTML5 video.</p>
                    </video>   

            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>
                There were quite a few ideas that we had while working on the project that we were unable to explore due to time constraints. Should we have time to work on this further, we would: 
            </p>
            <p>  1. Explore the option of a night time mode. Since our user would go onto the website after watching something, we wanted to incorporate a feature that would switch the screen to be darker. Marrying this with legibility and readability would present a challenge. 
              </p>

              <p>
                  2. We focused on the secondary navigation for the series pages, and the next step would be to discover what user would like to have in the film pages.                   
              </p>

              <p> 3. We didn’t have a chance to test the hi-fi prototype, therefore further testing would be needed. 
                </p>
