            <h1>Wirewax</h1> 
        <p>Working with our client Wirewax, my team and I redesigned the dashboard and how users save and locate their files within the software. We delivered a high fidelity prototype, a presentation outlining our process and discoveries, as well as a report to detail all our research and testing findings.   
          </p>   
             <h2>Overview</h2>

             <h3>Client: <a href="https://www.wirewax.com/studio/?gad&gclid=CjwKCAiA4OvhBRAjEiwAU2FoJVJ5UqSHz6BJn50rtPjTiHe-4oXACR8wZHM2E4dYNEqF9EvCz80nFhoCtRgQAvD_BwE#studio-main-page" target="_blank"> Wirewax</a>

        <h3>Project Brief</h3>

            <p>For our final project we worked with Wirewax, an interactive video editing software company headquartered in London. We were tasked to redesign the digital asset management within the system. I worked with three fellow UX Design students: Kjerstin (KJ) Engebretson, Emily Pela and Shruti Hallur.

                  <h3>Scope</h3> 
                    <p>2.5 week sprint. During the first week we conducted research and interviews. Our second week focused on the design and testing phases. In our remaining time, we collated our findings into a report and presentation. 
                    </p>
              </div>

              <div class="my-role">
                  <h3>My Role </h3> 
                    <p>Since we were working with a tight time frame, we evenly split all work. My contribution was conducting interviews, synthesizing our findings into a research presentation, creating the paper and mid fi prototype, testing with users, gathering data and iterating our design, and creating our final presentation. 
                    </p>

        <h2>Research</h2>

          <p>To gain an understanding of the current system and its pain points and opportunities, we created a screener survey, did a competitive analysis as well as conducted interviews and user testing.
          </p>

          <h3>User Testing</h3>

            <p>Starting with user testing of the current system, we identified some things which could be improved upon. During the tests, we observed how people created folders, moved items around in the system and uploaded assets. 
              </p>

              <div class="project-image">
                  <img src="./assets/WW-usertesting.png" alt="Netlix Research" />
              </div>

            <h3>Interviews</h3>
            <p>Following this, we interviewed Wirewax users as well as video editors within our own personal networks, and came up with some key findings. 
              </p>

              <h3>1 — Asset Organisation</h3>
              <p>Everyone we interviewed stated that they had a very particular way to name and organise their video assets. They like to have control over their folders for peace of mind. </p>
              
              <div class="project-quotes">
                <p>“I don’t want to waste time trying to find things so I have become very meticulous in naming.”</p>
              </div>  

              <h3>2 — Search</h3>
              <p>Wirewax has a very powerful search function and we assumed that some would use this to locate assets. However, 0% of users surveyed said they would use the search for this purpose. While speaking with them, they mentioned that they always know where assets are located because of their folder and naming systems. </p>
              <div class="project-quotes">
                <p>“I don’t use search because I usually know where everything is.”</p>
                </div> 

              
              <h3>3 — Work in Progress</h3>
              <p>Users want quick access to the projects they are currently working on. This is available in systems like Google drive, and when you open a software and click ‘recently opened.’</p>
                <div class="project-quotes">
                  <p>
                  “I create a folder called 'Work in Progress' in the system and place all of the assets inside it. That way I have quick access to what I’m working on [when I enter Wirewax].”
                  </p>
                    </div> 

              <h3>Persona</h3>

              <p>With this research, our persona took shape. With this tool, we were able to better understand the needs of the Wirewax user. 
                </p>

              <div class="project-image">
                  <img src="./assets/WW-persona.png" alt="Netlix Research" />
              </div>


              <h2>Ideation</h2> 

              <p>We conducted a design studio with Wirewax employees to generate ideas on how the digital asset management could look. Before the design studio began, we presented our research findings and what users were saying. To guide the session, we presented a few how might we statements.  </p>

              <h3>How Migh We ...</h3>

              <div class="headline">
                <p>Improve the folder structure in the DAM? the upload process? & the overall efficiency of the user’s workflow? </p>

                </div>


                <div class="project-image">
                    <img src="./assets/ww-designstudio.jpg" alt="Netlix Research" />
                </div>

                <div class="project-image">
                    <img src="./assets/ww-desingstudio-paper.jpg" alt="Netlix Research" />
                </div>

                <p>We then came out with several features, visuals and ideas. Using the MoSCoW method, we were able to prioritize the various features by plotting them on a map.</p>



                  <div class="project-image">
                      <img src="./assets/ww-moscow.png" alt="Netlix Research" />
                  </div>

                  <p>Moreover, we looked at the user flow, and broke it down to further pinpoint areas to focus our design on. This helped us to identify the key workflows for the system and the scenario to design for. </p>

                    <div class="project-image">
                        <img src="./assets/ww-userflow.png" />
                    </div>

                    <div class="project-image">
                        <img src="./assets/ww-features.png" />
                    </div>

                    <h2>Prototype Development</h2>
                    <p>Moving our ideas forwards, we designed paper prototypes to test on our classmates and general public before making digital wireframes. 
                      </p>

                    <div class="project-image">
                        <img src="./assets/WW-testing-prototype-2.jpg" alt="Netlix Research" />
                    </div>

                    <div class="image-text-flex">

                      <div class="image-text-flex-text">

                          <p>
                              Once our digital prototype was ready, we tested with Wirewax users, both in person and remotely. 
                              <p>We sought to gain feedback on the new dashboard, the features, upload process and how they created folders and organised assets.
                                  <p>We continued to iterate on the design with every version we tested.    
                          
                            </p>
                  

                      </div>

                          <div class="project-image-floating">
                            <img src="./assets/WW-testing-employees.jpg" alt="Netlix Research" />
                        </div>
    


                    </div>

                    <div class="project-image">
                        <img src="./assets/WW-prototype-iterations.png" alt="Netlix Research" />
                    </div>

                    <p>Having been given Wirewax’s style and brand guide, we rolled out the designs accordingly. 
                      </p>

                      <div class="project-image">
                          <img src="./assets/ww-mid-fi-sketch.png" alt="Netlix Research" />
                      </div>

                    <h2>Solution</h2>

                    <p>The updated Studio Dashboard and digital asset management allows users to more through the system, organise and locate files with ease. They can create folders easily, move items around using drag and drop, and are able to understand the visual hierarchy of their assets.
                      </p>

                    <div class="project-image">
                        <img src="./assets/WW-finaldesign.png" alt="Netlix Research" />
                    </div>

                    <p>The following high fidelity wireframe explores how a user would preform all of the essential tasks in the digital asset management system: upload a video, create a folder and organise the item into the folder. 
                      </p>

                      <div class="project-video">
                          <video width="100%" alight="center" autoplay loop muted controls>
                              <source src="./assets/Wirewax-hifi-folder.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                          </video>      
                    </div>

                    <p>We also developed how the folder structure would act with multiple subfolders and assets within. Another task we asked users to preform was changing the status of an asset, and getting their thoughts on the updated asset cards. 
                      </p>

                    <div class="project-video">
                        <video width="100%" alight="center" autoplay loop muted controls>
                            <source src="./assets/Wirewax-hifi-status.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                        </video>      
                  </div>

                      <h2>Outcome</h2>

                      <p>During testing, Wirewax users were very pleased with the concepts and design. All of the users we tested with were able to successfully complete tasks. Some of the things we heard from users were: </p>
                      
                      <div class="headline">
                        <p>"I love the edit button [on the asset card], it reduces the number of clicks." </p>
                        <p>"The folder system is so smart and familiar. This would be really helpful to have!"</p>
                        <p>"It’s brilliant and intuitive!"</p>
                      </div>
                    
                      <p>The outcome of the project was overwhelmingly positive, and Wirewax wanted to implement many of our ideas and learn more about the research and testing findings. Furthermore, we were asked to create an in-depth report highlighting all of our insights and findings. 
                      </p>
